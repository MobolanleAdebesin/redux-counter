# redux-counter 

## Purpose:

This small project is an introduction to state management using redux. The goal was to begin identifying how to implement the three principles of Redux: 
1. All changes to state are managed in a single location 
2. Rather than modifying state you can only write to it
3. Using pure functions to make changes to state
